### Prerequisites

libraries and packages you'll need that you probably don't already have installed:

```
Python
Open CV ( with support for cv2)

```

## Running and Using the code

The code can be broken down into two seperate sections:
1. masked_image_generator
2. boudning_box_crop_rotate

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
